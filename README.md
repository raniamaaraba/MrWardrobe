# MrWardrobe

Design and Sketching Process:
Original Idea is based on the 1995 film Clueless, where in the early minutes of the opening Cher, the main character, show's off her computer's outfit maker
This project is to resemble this if it were a separate panel attached to a closet and hooked up to the racks

Initial Design of the interactive UI:
