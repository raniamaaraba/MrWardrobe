Design and Sketching Process:
Original Idea is based on the 1995 film Clueless, where in the early minutes of the opening Cher, the main character, show's off her computer's outfit maker
This project is to resemble this if it were a separate panel attached to a closet and hooked up to the racks

Cher's Original Version:

### Getting Started:
If you do not know where to look--Mr Wardrobe has a getting started feature to show you your current user, how to use Mr Wardrobe, and colours for your defined season

### Side Pannel Buttons:
The idea of Mr Wardrobe is based around the season's colour assignment (see link above for more information) to help correlate outfits to the user based on their quiz answers. The sidebar includes the Getting started section, modifying your season/taking the quiz, returning to home, and a user-upload section to emulate scanning in new people to use in the wardrobe as well as if there was a feature to scan all the clothes in your closet.

### Seasons Quiz:
To resemble some of that of Cher's original design in the movie--the season's quiz includes a leopard print background similiar to her computer program's background. This quiz works on the logic based on Agnes from 30 Something Urban Girl to define the user based on eye color, skin tone, hair color, and lip stick color their correct season.

### Main Element--Closet Selection:
Once you have taken your quiz and return to the home--Mr Wardrobe calculates the probability that two clothing items will suit you based on your color seasons. Changing top or bottoms can change this result as well as if you were to retake the quiz.

### Design Process:
Most of the inspiration came from Cher's closet but as well as the implementation of Tailwind UI (credit to https://www.codewithfaraz.com/ for the many template types and UI inspiration) but also Meredith and myself's passion for fashion and figuring out what suits you best. Have you ever walked past a person and thought 'wow that color looks really good on them?' I had this revelation myself going to my prom my senior year of high school and wearing a royal blue dress and realised how amazing of a color it was on me. This turned into a rabbit hole of figuring out my season without the high price of getting your colors professionally done. Although Mr Wardrobe's test is not a 100% full-proof replacement for this it is close to being on it's way.

The concept of being able to upload your clothes and easily navigate what you already own and how to make new outfits that you previously could not think of was another driving force. Often in a day where social media often influences many consumer's to buy into micro-trends, using Mr Wardrobe to create new outfits to your latest '-core' obsession can help you understand the fundamentals of clothing in our lives as well as investing in high quality pieces that allow for such high levels of versatility without feeling the need to buy into the latest trend.
